The brown-capped babbler (Pellorneum fuscocapillus) is a member of the Pellorneidae family. The brown-capped babbler is an endemic resident breeding bird in Sri Lanka. Its habitat is forest undergrowth and thick scrub. This species, like most babblers, is not migratory, and has short rounded wings and a weak flight. This babbler builds its nest on the ground or in a hole, concealed in dense masses of foliage. The normal clutch is two or three eggs. The brown-capped babbler measures 16Â cm including its long tail. It is brown above and rich cinnamon below. It has a dark brown crown. Brown-capped babblers have short dark bills. Their food is mainly insects. They can be difficult to observe in the dense vegetation they prefer, but like other babblers, these are noisy birds, and their characteristic calls are often the best indication that these birds are present. In Sri Lanka, this bird is known as parandel-kurulla (translates to 'dried-grass(colored) bird') or redi diang (onomatopoeic in origin) in Sinhala language.[2] Brown-capped babbler appears in a 4 rupee Sri Lankan postal stamp,[3]
