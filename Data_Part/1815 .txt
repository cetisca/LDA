Schistocichla leucostigma brunneiceps The brownish-headed antbird (Schistocichla brunneiceps) is a species of bird in the family Thamnophilidae. Until recently, it was considered a subspecies of the spot-winged antbird, but based on differences in voice and plumage it has been recommended that they are treated as separate species. As presently defined, the brownish-headed antbird is monotypic. It is found in humid forest in the far south-western Amazon in Peru and Bolivia. Its conservation status has not been assessed by BirdLife International, but while it generally is uncommon, it is unlikely to be seriously threatened.
