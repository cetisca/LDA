Thryothorus leucotis The buff-breasted wren (Cantorchilus leucotis) is a species of bird in the Troglodytidae family, the wrens. It is found in the Amazon Basin of northern Brazil and Amazonian Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and northern-border Bolivia; also the Guianan countries Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana. It occurs in non-Amazonian regions of Venezuela and Colombia and its range extends into eastern Panama. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical mangrove forests, subtropical or tropical swamps, and heavily degraded former forest. The core range of the buff-breasted wren is northern and central South America, especially the Amazon Basin; the range does cover most of Venezuela, and northern Colombia extending into eastern Panama. In the west at the Andes and southwards through Amazonian eastern Peru, it only enters the extreme northwest border regions of Bolivia. The range covers the Guianas and the Amazon River outlet island: Marajo Island, Ilha de Marajo. The range southeastwards in Brazil covers the entire central-southern, and southeast Amazon Basin; from here the range extends almost to the southeast Atlantic coast of Brazil, but is mainly in the southern Cerrado, and possibly regions of the adjacent northeastern Pantanal. There are 11 subspecies covering this wide and variable range from Panama to southeast Brazil.
