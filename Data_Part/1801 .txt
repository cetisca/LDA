Oenanthe scotocerca The brown-tailed rock chat (Cercomela scotocerca) is a species of bird in the family Muscicapidae. It is found in Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, and Uganda. Its natural habitats are dry savanna and subtropical or tropical dry shrubland. The brown-tailed rock chat is included in the genus Cercomela. Molecular phylogenetic studies published in 2010 and 2012 found that the genus Cercomela was polyphyletic with five species, including the brown-tailed rock chat, phylogenetically nested within the genus Oenanthe, however many taxonomists continue to place the bird in Cercomela.[2][3] As part of a reorganization of the species to create monotypic genera, the brown-tailed rock chat was assigned to the genus Oenanthe.[4]
